        <p class="c-text">Adaptation practitioners face a confusing landscape of datasets, platforms and tools. Navigating the many fragmented resources available can be overwhelming, and most users still struggle to access the climate data they need.</p>

        <p class="c-text">The Partnership for Resilience and Preparedness (PREP) brings together public, private and civil society stakeholders committed to improving access to climate data. Together, this peer-to-peer initiative built PREPdata, an intuitive, map-based platform that enables users to visualize, download and layer data to inform adaptation decision-making. The platform also connects practitioners to data providers, closing the feedback loop between them and enhancing the climate data ecosystem.</p>

        <p class="c-text">PREPdata will provide access to curated climate, physical and socioeconomic datasets, allow users to monitor indicators on customized dashboards, create graphs, guide practitioners through the adaptation data landscapeâ€”and more.</p>
